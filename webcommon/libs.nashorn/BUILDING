The library is a subset of GraalJS Project (https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/). 
Since the original code contains small number of GraalVM substitutes for 
standard Collection classes, this wrapper library contains stubs of those types
implemented using JDK standard Collection classes. The original Java source code 
is unmodified. The original project delivers Graal Javascript parser and the 
runtime in one JAR; the build instructions are to be patched to produce
a separate JAR file just for the parser (see below).

When NetBeans application happens to run on GraalVM runtime, the real optimized
implementation will be picked up from the bootclasspath. On standard JDK, the 
wrapper's stub will be used.

To build the library, clone the original source (https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs.git), 
and patch it using file(s) in "patches" subdirectory. Currently only patch to
"mx" build metadata is required.

Run "mx build"; the library will be produced as file "mxbuild/dists/graal-js-parser.jar".
